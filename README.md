# RecipeRoller

### [Live site](https://reciperoller.herokuapp.com/)

## About
A website that allows users (a.k.a me) to store and view recipes consisting of ingredients and instructions. Also features a button that displays a random recipe from the stored recipes.
Note: The live site is meant for my personal use. Because of that adding recipes requires a key so that only I can add recipes.
